# Exercism Python Track

## About Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a fantastic site and tool that provides a wealth of daily code exercises. If you want to learn to be better in a language, itâ€™s a great resource to do exercises and receive feedback.

## About Python

Python is a dynamic and strongly typed object-oriented programming language. It employs both duck typing and gradual typing (via type hints). It supports multiple programming paradigms including imperative (object-oriented, procedural) and declarative (functional, concurrent) flavors. But do not be fooled: while programming across paradigms is fully supported, everything in Python is an object.

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. The Python Software Foundation manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development and receives proposals for changes to the language from members of the community via Python Enhancement Proposals or PEPs. It is considered a strong language for programmers starting their journey, with a welcoming community and many resources available to learners of all levels and persuasions.

Python puts a strong emphasis on code readability and (similar to Haskell) uses significant indentation to denote function, method, and class definitions. Code can be written and executed from the command line, in an interactive interpreter session, in JupyterLab (Jupyter notebook), or a wide variety of code editors and IDEs.

Python is used extensively in scientific computing, finance, games, networking, internet development, and in assembling pipelines of other programs.

The zen of Python (PEP 20) and What is Pythonic? lay out additional philosophies and perspectives on the language.

This track currently uses Python 3.9.0. It is highly recommended that students upgrade to at least Python 3.8, as some features used by this track may not be supported in earlier versions. That being said, most exercises can be completed using Python 3.7, and many can be worked in Python 3.6. We will note when a feature is only available in a certain version.

Complete documentation for the current release of Python can be found at [docs.python.org/3](https://docs.python.org/3/).

### The Zen of Python

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
